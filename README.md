# ML-Ilya-Demo

A simple demonstration of a machine learning model with GPU acceleration capability.

## Overview

This repository contains a PyTorch-based image classification model that can be trained and deployed on GPU hardware. The architecture is designed to demonstrate best practices for ML model development, with considerations for distributed training and inference.

## Features

- PyTorch-based convolutional neural network
- GPU acceleration support
- Modular architecture with separation of concerns
- Training and inference scripts
- Performance metrics logging

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA Toolkit (for GPU acceleration)
- Additional dependencies listed in requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run training: `python train.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 64`
4. Run inference: `python inference.py --model_path models/trained_model.pth --image_path sample.jpg`
